    "    Reviewing (and cleaning) data takes a lot of time and consumed much of our initial efforts\n",
    "    No single dataset contained all the variables needed to run our analyses, so we merged datasets\n",
    "    No unique identifier existed to link records across datasets.\n",
    "    Fields were often missing information. \n",
    "\n",
    "We had to sacrifice quantity of data in favor of fewer, more complete records\n",
    "\n",
    "Making meaningful predictions is dependent on having the right data, and on understanding if the data you have works with your model \n",
    "    Working through the model was more important than getting to a perfect fit\n",
    "\n",
    "Do it. Do it again. Keep doing it (a.k.a., practice, practice, practice) \n",
    "    Iterating over the model is necessary to work through the question youâ€™re trying to answer\n",
